# Welcome to Shotbot!
This project started as a discord bot, which you can find in my [Personal Projects](https://github.com/hinemp/Personal-Projects). If you'd like to see the initial creation of this app, the commit history is also in that repository, as I hadn't initially planned to give this it's own repo.

I decided to move beyond the scope of a simple Discord bot, as the Discord.js library was creating limitations for me.
