# Welcome to Shotbot!
This project started as a discord bot, which you can find in my [Personal Projects](https://github.com/hinemp/Personal-Projects). If you'd like to see the initial creation of this app, the commit history is also in that repository, as I hadn't initially planned to give this it's own repo.

I decided to move beyond the scope of a simple Discord bot, as the Discord.js library was creating limitations for me.

This project is meant to display some of my React skills, as well as my ability to consume third party APIs. This is why I chose to use Bootstrap, as for right now, the style of this app does not matter to me very much.

## Roadmap
At the very least with this project, I want to implement the full functionality of my discord bot, which includes: rank lookup, the ability to compare two players in games they played together, as well as other features.

After that I hope to add a general information page, which can retrieve the latest patch notes, shop items, etc.
